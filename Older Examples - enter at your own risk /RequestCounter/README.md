RequestCounter
==============
This example counts incoming requests (based on a particular key) and reacts in two ways:

- It moves a servo to the left or right to indicate a Tug-Of-War.
- It displays the number of 'left' and 'right' requests that have come in since the code started running.

Hardware
========
This code uses a Micro Servo, and an [Eight digital serial (SPI) seven segment LED display](https://www.tindie.com/products/rajbex/spi7segdisp856-kit-eight-digit-serial-spi-seven-segment-led-display-yellow/) from Tindie.
