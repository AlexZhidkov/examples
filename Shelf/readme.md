The goal of the shelºF project was to build a smarter internet connected thermostat system. The current internet connected options, such as Nest, offer a very expensive and outdated system where the wired wall unit is still present. This project gets rid of the old wall unit and makes the system completely wireless by having a control unit near the heating/cooling system in the garage or basement and several sensors hidden in books throughout the house. Both these devices use Electric Imps to connect to the internet making this a truly wireless system. All UI has been moved to the app, which asks the user for their comfort level in order to determine how to regulate the temperature. This gets rid of all the complex wiring, cuts down on the product cost significantly and gives the user the option to provide room by room temperature feedback.

All the code needed to run this project is publicly available, which includes the control unit agent and device code, the tempbook agent and device code and the iOS app code.
