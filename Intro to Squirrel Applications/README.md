# Intro to Squirrel Applications

The examples here range from simple to advanced programming.  Each example builds on the skills learned in the previous example.  

## Example 1 - Reading a Sensor

Begin by learning the basics of working with Electric Imp. We will use Electric Imp HTS221 library to take temperature and humidity readings from a sensor. We will also use the Initial State libary to send the data we collect from the sensor to the cloud. This code can be easily configured for use with an impExplorer Developer Kit or impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node.  

## Example 2 - Simple Monitoring Application

## Example 3 - Asynchonous Monitoring Application

## Example 4 - Simple Smart Refigerator

## Example 5 - Power Efficient Monitoring Application

## Example 6 - Monitoring Application with Interrupt

## Example 7 - Advanced Smart Refrigerator
